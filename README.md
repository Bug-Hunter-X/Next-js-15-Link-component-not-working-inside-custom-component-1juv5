# Next.js 15 Link Component Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Next.js 15 `Link` component within a custom component. The links fail to navigate correctly, preventing proper routing within the application.

## Problem Description

The `Link` component, when placed inside `MyComponent`, does not function as intended. Clicking the links does not trigger the expected navigation to the specified routes ('/' and '/about').

## Solution

The issue stems from a potential conflict or unexpected behavior of the `Link` component within the custom component's structure. To resolve this, we can try one or more of these approaches: 
* Ensure proper wrapping and nesting of components.
* Verify that Next.js configuration is correct, specifically related to routing.
* Consider using `useRouter` hook in complex scenarios.

The solution implemented in this repository demonstrates a potential fix using techniques mentioned above and/or further investigation on the custom component's structure.
